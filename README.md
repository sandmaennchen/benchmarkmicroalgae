# Microalgae Raceway Reactor Control Benchmark

This repository provides an open and reproducible **control benchmark for outdoor microalgae raceway reactors**, designed to evaluate and compare regulatory and advanced control strategies under realistic environmental disturbances and actuator constraints.

The benchmark integrates **four coupled control problems**:

- pH regulation via CO₂ injection  
- Dissolved oxygen (DO) regulation via air bubbling  
- Culture volume regulation through coordinated harvest–dilution actions  
- Temperature regulation using a sump-mounted spiral heat exchanger  

It is built upon a **high-fidelity, experimentally calibrated dynamic model** capturing the thermal, physicochemical, and biological processes governing industrial-scale open raceway ponds.

A closed-loop simulation environment is provided, including realistic actuator constraints, gas transport delays, stiff integration, and a fully specified multi-day outdoor disturbance scenario (irradiance, temperature, wind, and humidity).

## IFAC World Congress 2026 - Bechmark competition

The [IFAC World Congress 2026](https://ifac2026.org/) will feature a collection of benchmark problems addressing representative challenges in control systems. These problems aim to support standardized evaluation, stimulate methodological advances, and encourage collaboration across the research community.

Our **Benchmark Control Problem on microalgae production systems** is one of the challenges selected for IFAC WC 2026. Important information about deadlines and registration is available on the Benchmark Challenge website:

https://ifac2026.org/fairContents.do?FAIRMENU_IDX=21707&hl=ENG#scroll-2

Participants are invited to read the benchmark challenge instructions in [Handbook_Benchmark_IFACWC.pdf](IFAC_WC_player/Handbook_Benchmark_IFACWC.pdf) and use the files in the `IFAC_WC_player/` folder.

## Requirements

* MATLAB (tested with stiff ODE solvers)
* No additional toolboxes are required beyond standard MATLAB functionality

---

## How to Run the Benchmark

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open MATLAB and add the repository to the MATLAB path.
3. Navigate to the `player/` folder.
4. Run the main simulation script:

```matlab
Benchmark_main
```

The script:

* Loads the dynamic process model and disturbance scenarios
* Executes a closed-loop simulation over a multi-day horizon
* Calls the user-defined control strategies
* Generates time-series plots of key process variables
* Computes control and performance metrics

---

## Control Architecture

The benchmark is structured around **four independent controller functions**, each responsible for a specific regulation task:

| Control Task | Manipulated Variable | Default Controller                |
| ------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| pH           | CO₂ injection        | `controller_pH_OnOff.m`           |
| DO           | Air bubbling         | `controller_DO_OnOff.m`           |
| Volume       | Harvest/Dilution     | `controller_HD_fixed.m`           |
| Temperature  | Heat exchanger       | `controller_Temp_HX_no_control.m` |

The controller functions are specified in **lines 10–13 of `Benchmark_main.m`**.

---

## Implementing Your Own Controllers

Users are encouraged to:

* Modify the provided controller files, or
* Implement custom control algorithms (PI, PID, MPC, EMPC, rule-based, etc.)

Controller function names may be freely changed, **provided the corresponding function calls in `Benchmark_main.m` are updated accordingly**.

This modular design enables rapid prototyping and fair comparison of alternative control strategies under identical operating conditions.
